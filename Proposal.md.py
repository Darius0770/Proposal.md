# Preproposal
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to create a small video game
I was thinking something like Pong, or Flappy Bird
I was even thinking about a visual novel kind of game
I also wouldn't mind building an app




## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I plan on working solo



#Do you have any questions of your own?
Where would we code to build an app or game for iPhone?
How would we publish it to the app store if we finish it?
